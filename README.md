# GameMakerStudioProject
This project and all of its assets were developed by Hunter McCormick.
This game was made as an assignment for the CS 339 Game Design I course offered at Jacksonville State University.
This project was started on January 6th, 2019 and was completed on January 14th, 2019. 
For this assignment, we were tasked to recreate the classic game Frogger and make our own version of it. 
The game was developed using the Game Maker Studio 2 software. 
The game was programmed in the software's own programming language, GML (Game Maker Language).
All of the game's art was made using the in-engine art tools. 
This game was created to closely mimic the 1981 arcade version of Frogger developed by Konami. 
The objective of the game is to get the frog across a road and river to collect four lily pads. 
Once all of the lily pads have been collected, then the player wins the game. 
The player controls a frog that is moved with the arrow keys on the keyboard. 
The player will have to press the arrow keys in order to move the frog in the corresponding direction. 
The obstacles that the player faces are the vehicles that move on the road and the water in the river.
If a player comes into contact with a vehicle or the water, then they are teleported back to the start of the level.
If a player moves tor far right or left on the screen, then they will become out of bounds and will teleport back to the start of the level. 
There are three different types of vehicles: A red car, a blue car, and a bus. 
The bus moves at the slowest speed, while the red car moves at the fastest speed. 
Vehicles will move from left to right and right to left on the road. 
There are logs in the river that move horizontally from the left and right sides of the screen that the player can move onto in order to avoid falling into the water. Once the player moves onto a log, they will begin to move in the same direction the log is moving at the same speed until they move off or onto another log. 
The lily pads are positioned at different points across the top of the screen. 
Once a player comes into contact with one of the lily pads, the lily pad disappears, and the player is teleported to the beginning of the level.
There is a counter at the top left of the screen that displays how many lily pads the player has collected.
Once the player has made contact with a lily pad, the lily pad counter will increment by one. 

This repository contains all of the files for the game. 
In order to run the game, you will need to have Game Maker Studio 2 installed on your device.
